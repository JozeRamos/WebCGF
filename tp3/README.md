## TP 3 Notes

- For the first part of this exercise we had to correct the normals from the cube and the tangram and then we had to create a material that was similar to wood. This was very easy and straightforward, since we had a lot of examples both in the slides and in the code itself.

- The second part on the other hand was much harder than the first one, we had to color the tangram and apply the custom material to the diamond. We were somewhat confused in how we were supposed to create the materials in the tangram class, but after a while it was pretty clear that we just needed to do like it was in the scene. After the fact, we got to another hurdle, that being, applying the custom material just to the diamond. To so was actually very easy, all we needed was an if statement, however, that conclusion took us some time.

- The third part of the this project was by far the hardest. We had to create a prism with a variable number of slices and stacks. To do the points of the prism was easy, all we had to do was divide PI*2 by the number of slices, and then put the points on a trigonometric circle. The hard part started after that, with the indices, we had to do a lot of calculations previous to implementation, and with trial and error we were able to do it. After that we had to correct the normals of the prism, this was quite the catch, once again we had to make some calculations beforehand, at the end of it all we just calculate the angle of the plane and then calculate the normal from there.

- The last part of this project was very easy, all we had to do was to create a cylindrical surface - Aplication of Gouraud shading. Overral all we did was modify the prism that we created in the exercise before.
